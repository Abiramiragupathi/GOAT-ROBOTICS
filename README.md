# GOAT-ROBOTICS

##Q1)Grid Robots:


This program simulates a robot navigating through a grid, finding the shortest path from a starting point to an endpoint while avoiding obstacles. It uses the A algorithm*, a popular pathfinding method, to calculate the best route. The obstacles on the grid are randomly moving, adding a dynamic element to the navigation.

Steps to Run the Program:

pip install pygame

Save the Code: Copy and paste the provided code into a new file, for example, robot_navigation.py.

Run the Script: After saving the code, you can run it in your terminal or command prompt:
python robot_navigation.py

How to use:

Set the Start Point: Click on any empty grid cell to select where the robot should start.

Set the End Point: After selecting the start point, click on another empty cell to set the robot's destination.

The robot will automatically calculate the path from the start to the end using the A algorithm* and begin moving.

Q2)Robot Center Movement:

Steps to Run:
Install Python and Pygame:

Install Python: Download Python.
Install Pygame:
pip install pygame

Run the Program:
Open a terminal, navigate to the file location, and run:
python robot_navigation.py

How to use:
Step 1: Click to set the robot's start position (green circle).

Step 2: Click four times to set the vertices of the pillar (red squares).

Step 3: The simulation starts, with the robot navigating towards the goal (center of pillar).

Step 4: The robot moves and avoids obstacles.
End: The simulation ends when the robot reaches the goal
